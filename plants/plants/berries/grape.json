      "zone": "2-10 (varies by variety; American and French-American more cold-hardy, European prefer warmer zones)",
      "sun": "Full sun (at least 7-8 hours per day for best fruit production)",
      "water": "Moderate; drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during dry spells, especially during fruiting",

      "whenToPlant": "Early spring after the last hard freeze; soak bare roots for 2-3 hours before planting",
      "propagation": "Usually by dormant cuttings or grafted plants; seeds rarely used due to variability",
